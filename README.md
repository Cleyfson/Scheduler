# Scheduler
 
A small project developed in C++ language, for the discipline of Algorithms and Data Structures. The idea behind the code is to simulate a process scheduler, that is, the subsystem of an OS that chooses which process will be executed by the CPU. To do this, we use a basic Priority Queue using a Linked List.

It is possible to simulate this process through the following input commands to the program <br />

**input a:** followed by id, name, priority. will add a new process to the list according to the parameters passed <br />
**input m:** command to remove the HIGHEST priority process from the list. <br />
**input n:** command to remove the LOWEST priority process from the list. <br />
**input r:** followed by id, command to remove a process from the list according to the given ID. <br />
**input p:** command to print all processes in the list <br />
